# InformatikPraktikum
This project was done for one of my master courses called Informatik Praktikum (computer science internship).
In this course every student should decide on a topic and try to implement it. 
For my topic I decided to try and implement a particle system. I choose to do it in the Unreal Engine.
This project is the result of that implementation. 
New particles (spheres) are created at the location of the mouse and those interact with the other particles that already exist in the scene.
